# flutter_conditional_rendering

A flutter package which enhances conditional rendering, supports `if`-`else` and `switch` conditions.

## Why

In flutter if you want to do conditional rendering, you may do this:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        if (someCondition == true)
          Text('The condition is true!'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

But what if you want to use a tertiary (`if`-`else`) condition?

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        someCondition == true ?
          Text('The condition is true!'):
          Text('The condition is false!'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

It is okay for a single `Text` widget, but the readability quickly become very bad when the child widget is multi-layered.

## Usage

### If-Else condition:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Conditional.single(
          conditionBuilder: () => someCondition == true,
          widgetBuilder: () => Text('The condition is true!'),
          fallbackBuilder: () => Text('The condition is false!'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Switch condition:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        ConditionalSwitch.single(
          valueBuilder: () => 'A',
          caseBuilders: {
            'A': () => Text('The value is A!'),
            'B': () => Text('The value is B!'),
          },
          fallbackBuilder: () => Text('None of the cases matched!'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

## Want a list of widgets?

If you want to conditionally render a list of widgets (`List<Widget>`) instead of a single one. Use `Conditional.list()` and `ConditionalSwitch.list()`!
